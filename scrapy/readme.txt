How to test:
Install python-scrapy: pip install python-scrapy or use your package manager to install python-scrapy in Linux.
Anaconda shell works well on Windows: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#windows
Install spoonacular API for python: pip install spoonacular
Developers: ipdb might be helpful for debugging, but it isn't used in the final code.

Run
    cd [this directory]/bon_spider
    scrapy crawl bon_spider_scrapy_spider_create_db
